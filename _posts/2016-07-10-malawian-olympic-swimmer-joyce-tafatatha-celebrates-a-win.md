The Malawi Aquatic Union (MAU) is affiliated to FINA 
(International Swimming Federation), CANA (African body governing 
swimming), the Malawi Olympic Committee and the Malawi National Council 
of Sports.  

Since 2000, when the MAU started, Malawi has 
participated in 4 Sub-Saharan Invitational galas, the Athens Olympics 
(2004),  the Manchester Commonwealth Games (July 2002) and the All 
Africa Games in Abuja, 2003\.  Regular open water events have occurred 
annually at Club Makakola.  Swim coaches have been trained through the 
FINA development program and swimming has been encouraged at a number of
schools in Blantyre, Kasungu, Lilongwe and Zomba.

2007/2008 is a particularly exciting year as Malawi 
will be hosting the 5 CANA Zone 4 Invitational gala (previously known 
as the Sub-Saharan Invitational Gala) in Lilongwe from 3-5 January 
2008\.  The World Swim for Malaria during April will be a major 
highlight during the 2007/2008 season. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2e157efa-af0c-471f-94a1-32b2af426412.jpg)
